# Data Structures Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on data structures and memory management:

## 1. Virtual Memory Allocator

The **Virtual Memory Allocator** simulates memory allocation (`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`) in C, using a doubly linked list to manage memory blocks.

### Key Features:
- Simulates a **contiguous memory buffer** (arena) for allocation.
- Handles **memory block allocation/freeing**, data read/write, and permission changes.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid memory operations.

## 2. Load Balancer

The **Load Balancer** distributes tasks to servers using hash rings. It handles **server addition/removal** and **task allocation** efficiently.
